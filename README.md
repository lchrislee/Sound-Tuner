# Sound-Tuner
An extension that allows you to change the volume of each tab.

## This project is deprecated. I will have to come back to this in the future. There's a lot of things to think about for volume.

1. Multiple sources from a single tab. Many may be of different volumes and content (e.g. ads, side news stories, chat feed).
2. Late additions to the page (e.g. added as a result of user action).
